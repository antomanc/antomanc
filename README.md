## 👋 Hi there, I'm Antonio Mancini

# 💻 Software Developer

I'm an Italian software developer who loves coding for the web, mobile, backend, with some experience on DevOps and AI.

I run a self-hosted homelab and I run a personal blog:  
🌐 [dev.antomanc.com](https://dev.antomanc.com)  
There, I share what I'm working on, document my tech experiments, and write guides to help others.

My daily driver is **Arch Linux**, and I'm running **Hyprland** as my window manager.
I highly recommend [dots-hyprland](https://github.com/end-4/dots-hyprland) as dotfiles for Hyprland.
