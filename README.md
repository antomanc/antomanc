## 👋 Hi there, I'm Antonio Mancini

# 💻 Software Developer

I spend most of my time building things for the web and mobile — but I also enjoy diving into backend systems, DevOps automation, and the occasional bit-twiddling low-level coding

I run a self-hosted homelab where I host my personal site & blog:  
🌐 [dev.antomanc.com](https://dev.antomanc.com)  
There, I share what I'm working on, document my tech experiments, and write guides to help others — especially newcomers.

My daily driver is proudly powered by **Arch Linux**, and I'm running **Hyprland** as my window manager.

> Always learning
